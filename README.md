# capstone-project
Project serving as proof of concept for a website using Google search API to locate in-stock vinyl records across the web.
For fans of vinyl records, Vinyl Finder serves as a website for people to quickly look up their favorite records and determine whether or not they are in-stock, and allow them to
  find any available records at affordable prices. Features a simple homepage, search page containing an API, an about page describing a bit about myself and reasons for creating
  the site, and a contact page to leave comments or concerns for me.
Utilizes JavaScript, HTML, CSS and web browser API.
