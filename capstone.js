Not long after, I began searching for copies of albums that I liked! Imagine my surprise when I find that there is no easy way to search and quickly be able to compare pricing and availability between various websites. I wanted to simplify the vinyl record search process.<br><br>Whether searching for your first record or adding to your extensive collection, this website was created with the intention of making the search for some of those hard to find records easier.")
